Road trip Chicago - Las Vegas
Jan 30, 2018, 10:36 AM

Doing an RV road trip from Chicago to Las Vegas at the end of february, beginning of march.

We have about 14 days to get to Vegas (should be plenty of time i think) but haven't really decided on the route.

I've read several posts on here and other websites looking for tips and advice. So the real question may be, which route offers the most cool sights, including, but not limited to nature and cultural spots.

for example, i'd love to see the cadilac ranch, but also the arches of bryce canyon.

Any and all tips are welcome. We're not in a hurry, the journey is the destination.
