We are a family of 4, coming from Australia in early April 2019 to visit Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks. We have 6 to 8 weeks time to do the trip. We plan to hire a RV, in order to save money via casino camping, state forest camping and boondocking. We are both licenced to drive vehicles of a similar length to what we'll be hiring, but it will be our first time RV'ing. We're heading from LA to the Grand Canyon first, then to Yosemite. We'd like advice on routes between the Mojave National Preserve and Yosemite. We're considering returning to LA after Yosemite and swapping the RV for a car, in order to head up to Oregon then over to Yellowstone. Any thoughts on these plans? (Portland OR is the only major city we're interested in visiting.) Thanks
